## Project Summary\
This project is an implementation of an ALU. This ALU only implements the "add" function.

## Project Objective\
*Half Adder in System Verilog\
*Full Adder in System Verilog\
*Ripple-Carry Adder using 32 FUll Adders
*5 total testcases (5 pairs of 32 bit numbers)\
*Analysis\
*Report\\

## Implementation Summary\
*Input: Two 32 bit numbers. Carry in hardcoded as 0.
*Output: One 32 bit number that represents the two 32 bit numbers added together\
*System Verilog will be used to design a Half Adder, A Full Adder, and a ripple carry adder\
*The Ripple Carry Adder will be designed with the usage of the half adder and full adder modules.\
*EDAPLayground will be used to implement and test the project
